### Hi there, I'm Taylor Moog ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently learning coding skills to eventually break into the tech industry. I'm passionate about creating things in order to serve others (whether through baking bread, cross stitching a gift, or now - coding!). 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning Python through a coding mentorship program through my workplace. This program includes:
* Practice exercises
* Weekly readings & lectures
* Weekly quizzes
* A Final Exam

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about... anything, really. Or better yet, tell me something about yourself! I love getting to know people - preferably over coffee or going for a walk.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have an M. Ed. in Counseling Psychology and previously worked in Education. I think this experience helps me to have a well-rounded skill set that allows me to excel in the technical space and interpersonally.
